		<p style="text-align:center;" class="anim">Two-thirds of the world's population can't digest milk. America is one of the few countries where some people can tolerate milk consumption. Not only that, but we've been advised to include it in our daily breakfast, whether with cereal, oatmeal, or just as a glass of milk. It's often claimed that milk helps with calcium production and makes bones stronger. However, this isn't entirely accurate. Overconsumption of milk can actually weaken bones and make them more prone to breakage. Have we ever considered where countries that don't consume milk get their calcium? Calcium can be found in a wide variety of foods, but the majority of it doesn't come from milk. For example, China generally doesn't consume milk, and since most of the world's population is lactose intolerant, drinking milk can cause stomach problems.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center;" class="anim">To cater to vegans and lactose-intolerant individuals, companies have started producing almond milk and oat milk as alternatives to cow's milk. This has allowed people to enjoy coffee without worrying about its impact on their stomachs. However, it's essential to understand that excessive consumption of chemically processed milk substitutes can harm your body.</p>
