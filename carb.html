		<p style="text-align:center;" class="anim">The government has promoted the consumption of carbohydrates because it's an economical way to provide a substantial amount of food to the population. There are two main types of carbohydrates: unrefined and refined. Unrefined carbs are organic, whole grains with nothing removed from them. Refined grains, on the other hand, cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels and can lead to insulin resistance. Cereal is an example of a refined carbohydrate, and it was created by John H. Kellogg, who invented cornflakes because he believed that sugar was sinful. While that might be a stretch, it is true that excessive sugar intake can lead to various health problems. Both sugar and carbohydrates are major contributors to type two diabetes, as they cause the pancreas to produce excess insulin, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels.</p>
